# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashwath Raj

🔧 I’m currently focused on:
- **C programming** using *The C Programming Language* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R)
- **Python fundamentals** and building CLI tools
- Mastering **data structures** like Linked Lists
- Running and testing code in **remote Linux environments** via SSH

📘 No frameworks, no fluff — just building strong foundations.

## 🧠 Core Skills
- CRUD with Linked Lists (C and Python)
- Working directly with memory and pointers (C)
- Writing clean CLI-based tools
- Remote program execution using SSH

## 📂 Projects (Built From Scratch)

### [📋 Linked List CRUD - C & Python](#)
- Implemented full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- One version in C (manual memory handling)
- Another in Python (dynamic list logic)
- Shows deep understanding of data structures

### [🌦️ Weather CLI Tool (OpenWeather API)](#)
- Built earlier using Python and public API
- Reads weather data based on city input
- Practiced real-world API usage and error handling

### [🖥️ Remote Python Execution via SSH](#)
- Ran Python code from my PC on a remote Linux server
- Used `ssh` and `scp` to connect and execute
- Shows real-world system-level programming knowledge

> All projects are part of my core journey — no distractions, no bloated tools. Just mastering the craft.
